# PTPC
Physical Trajectory Prediction for Commands in a Self-Driving Setting

This folder contains the code for the PTPC model and is currently provided as-is.

# Checkpoint

Our best performing PTPC model can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1P0_reRIVE9Ojgu2IHZOwcOIwletJJYuo/view?usp=sharing).
This is a model that is better than in the paper (uses the ROBERTA model instead of sentence-BERT).
Put the model in a folder called `checkpoint` at this level.

You will also need to download the ROBERTA model (https://zenodo.org/record/4721981/files/pretrained_EB5_checkpoint.pth?download=1) and put it in the same checkpoint folder.
